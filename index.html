                        Gwyn, the Lord of Cinder, stands as an indomitable figure amidst the annals of legend and lore.
                        With an aura that burns brighter than the sun itself, he embodies the epitome of power, majesty,
                        and divine authority. As the ruler of Lordran, the crumbling kingdom of gods, Gwyn's legacy
                        reverberates through the ages, casting an everlasting shadow upon the world.
                        <br>
                        Clad in resplendent armor that gleams with ethereal radiance, Gwyn possesses a regal countenance
                        befitting a deity. His long, flowing hair dances with crackling embers, mirroring the untamed
                        fire that courses through his veins. With every step, his mighty spear, imbued with the primal
                        essence of lightning, leaves trails of awe and reverence in its wake.
                        <br>
                        Yet, it is not merely his physical prowess that defines Gwyn, but his profound role in shaping
                        the destiny of Lordran. In ages long past, he sacrificed himself to kindle the First Flame,
                        ushering in the Age of Fire and igniting the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. The embers of
                        his soul burn eternally, sustaining the fading flame that maintains the fragile balance of the
                        world.
                        <br>
                        Gwyn's rule embodies both benevolence and authoritarian might. His divine authority demands
                        unwavering loyalty, yet he is not without compassion, having raised mighty knights and embraced
                        a paternal role in safeguarding his kingdom. With his elite Four Knights by his side, renowned
                        for their valor and unwavering loyalty, he strove to protect Lordran from the encroaching
                        darkness that threatened to engulf it.
                        <br>
                        Yet, despite his grandeur, Gwyn's legacy is not devoid of tragedy. As the flame wanes and the
                        Age of Fire reaches its twilight, his once-majestic visage reflects a weary sorrow. A poignant
                        reminder of the ephemeral nature of power and the inevitable march of time.
                        <br>
                        Gwyn, the Lord of Cinder, remains an indelible symbol of divine might and the complex interplay
                        between sacrifice and the burdens of kingship. His story echoes throughout the realms of
                        fantasy, immortalized in tales of valor, conflict, and the eternal struggle between light and
                        dark.

                        Gwyn, the Soul of Light, along with the other two souls would

                        possess the power to bring change to the

                        world, as they no longer needed to live

                        under the rule of the dragons. They knew

                        that if they would cooperate with one

                        another, and use their newly found

                        abilities to fight for the same cause,

                        they could overthrow the dragons and

                        become the new rulers of the ashen world.

                        And thus, preparations began, and war was

                        imminent. Once they were ready, the three

                        Lords waged war on the dragons, the Witch

                        of Izalith and her daughters weaved

                        deadly firestorms that would incinerate

                        the lands, Gwyn would project his mighty

                        lightning bolts towards the dragons,

                        piercing their scales and sending them

                        spiralling towards the ground, and Nito

                        would deliver the "killing blow by

                        unleashing a miasma of death and disease

                        upon them." Alongside Gwyn, were his four

                        trusted knights. One of which was Knight

                        Artorias, who was the commander of Lord

                        Gwyn’s army. As described by his

                        Wolf Ring: "Artorias had an unbendable

                        will of steel, and was unmatched with a

                        great sword."

                        Also involved in the war was Hawkeye

                        Gough, who later details his experience

                        fighting in the battle against the

                        dragons. According to the Hawk Ring, Gough

                        was the leader of the Greatarchers and

                        his abilities with a great bow were

                        unmatched, "taking down high-flying

                        dragons", allowing Artorias and his allies

                        to slay the dragons from the ground.

                        Gwyn’s third Knight was Dragonslayer

                        Ornstein, who was "believed to be the

                        captain of the Four Knights" according to

                        Ornstein’s Armor description. The Hornet

                        Ring reveals that the final Knight was

                        Lord’s Blade Ciaran, who was notorious

                        for using a dagger to lay waste to Lord

                        Gwyn's enemies. The unsung heroes of the

                        war were the humans, who fought as the

                        Ringed Knights, the Dragonhead Shield

                        description reveals that “The Ringed

                        Knights, by command of the gods, stood

                        amongst the ranks who set out to slay the

                        dragons, but their contributions were

                        never lauded." This indicates that the

                        Ringed Knights were never honoured for

                        their allegiance, and their involvement

                        was kept undisclosed. They were also

                        tasked with forging armour and weapons to

                        aid in the battle, as explained by the

                        the Ringed Knight set, stating “The armour of

                        early men was forged in the Abyss”.

                        Although for the longest time, the

                        warriors spoken of, were known to be the

                        only ones who fought in the war against

                        the dragons, the truth would later be

                        revealed, showing that history had been

                        re-written, unfolding that there was

                        indeed another warrior involved, one that

                        had been unspoken off for many years. That

                        warrior being Gwyn’s first born son, the

                        Nameless King. The Ring of the Sun’s

                        First Born states the following, “The Sun's

                        first born was once a god of war, until he

                        was stripped of his stature as

                        punishment for his foolishness. No wonder

                        his very name slipped from the annals of

                        history." This tells the story of Gwyn's

                        eldest son being present in the war, the

                        fact that he's described as a god of war,

                        indicates how truly masterful he was in

                        battle. The Dragonslayer Swordspear

                        describes him as a “Deific hunter of

                        dragons”, further amplifying his abilities.

                        With all of this being said, what could have

                        possibly happened to wipe this warrior's

                        name from history, denoting him to a

                        failure who’s name is forgotten, hence

                        why he is now known as The Nameless King. The

                        Soul of the Nameless King reveals that

                        “he sacrificed everything to ally himself

                        with the ancient dragons”, explaining that

                        his betrayal of his father resulted in

                        all of his accolades being stripped from

                        him. The Lightning Storm description

                        reads “Once a slayer of dragons, the

                        former king and wargod tamed a Stormdrake,

                        on which he led a lifetime of

                        battle." This statement reveals that after

                        taming the stormdrake, the Nameless King

                        made the decision to side with the

                        dragons, and leave behind his reputation

                        and all the good will that he had

                        obtained over the years. The once revered

                        and respected warrior, turned into a

                        Nameless being, whose existence may as

                        well have never taken place.

                        The Nameless King was not the sole

                        traitor of his kind, as during the battle

                        with the Dragons, there was a betrayal

                        that took place that would tip the

                        scales in favour of the Lords. The dragons

                        were betrayed by one of their very own,

                        Seath, the Scaleless. Seath was different

                        from the other dragons, as stated by his

                        name, he had no scales, and this likely

                        enabled him to be envious and resentful

                        towards the other dragons, he may have even

                        been treated differently, and thus when

                        the chance presented itself, he took

                        liberty in turning against his own kind,

                        siding with the Lords instead. Another

                        reason for his betrayal is Gwyn’s

                        promise of giving Seath control over the

                        Archives, which is described as having “a

                        trove of precious tomes and letters” This

                        would appeal to seth as the Moonlight

                        Greatsword informs that "Seath is the

                        grandfather of sorcery, and this sword is

                        imbued with his magic, which shall be

                        unleashed as a wave of moonlight."
